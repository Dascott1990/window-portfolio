 *  2. "Guest Mode"  — 3-step wizard: your info → paste job description → AI tailors resume
 *
 * Guest flow:
 *   Step 1 · Who are you?        (name, title, location, contact, brief background)
 *   Step 2 · Paste job posting   (raw text from any job board)
 *   Step 3 · AI generates        (keyword-matched bullets, ATS-ready, downloads as DOCX/PDF)
